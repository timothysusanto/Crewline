# Crewline — Webhook Skeleton (Build Step 1)

Telegram-first workforce platform for deskless teams (hospitality, cleaning, security).
Staff clock in, set availability, answer shift offers and file credentials by messaging a
Telegram bot — no Meta business verification needed. WhatsApp remains as an optional
fallback. Setup: `docs/telegram-channel.md`.

> The sections below are the original step-1 build notes, written when WhatsApp was the
> only channel. **This is step 1 of the build order**
in `docs/backend-build-scope.md`: prove the pipe —
WhatsApp message → Meta Cloud API → this webhook → sender lookup → reply.

No business logic lives here yet. Clock-in (step 2), the manager dashboard
(step 3), and vision-based stock/P&L flows (steps 4–5) each arrive as separate
handler modules. Frontend unified, backend modular — see
`docs/hospitality-app-decisions-log.md`.

**This project is designed to run 100% in the browser — no installs on your
PC.** GitHub hosts the code, Railway runs it, Meta connects to it. Your
computer only needs a web browser.

## What you need (all free to create, browser-only)

- A GitHub account — github.com
- A Railway account — railway.app (sign in with GitHub; hosting ≈ $5/month)
- A Meta developer app with the WhatsApp product added —
  developers.facebook.com → Create App → type **Business** → add **WhatsApp**

## Step 1 — Put the code on GitHub (browser upload)

1. github.com → **New repository** → name it `crewline` → Create
2. On the empty repo page, click **"uploading an existing file"**
3. Unzip the project on your PC (right-click → Extract; built into
   Windows/Mac, nothing to install) and drag **all files and folders** into
   the upload box
4. Click **Commit changes**

## Step 2 — Deploy on Railway

1. railway.app → **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** →
   select `crewline`
2. Railway auto-detects Node, installs dependencies, and starts the server —
   on Railway's machines, not yours
3. Go to **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain** — you get a permanent
   public URL like `https://crewline-production.up.railway.app`

## Step 3 — Set the secrets (Railway → Variables tab)

Add these five (a simple web form — you never create a `.env` file):

| Variable | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `WHATSAPP_TOKEN` | Meta dashboard → WhatsApp → API Setup |
| `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | Same page, just below the token |
| `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` | Any password-like string **you invent** — you'll type the same value into Meta in Step 4 |
| `META_APP_SECRET` | Meta dashboard → App Settings → Basic → App Secret |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | See "Set up Firebase" below. Leave blank to run on in-memory data for early testing. |

Railway redeploys automatically after you save variables.

## Set up Firebase (browser-only, needed from build step 2 onward)

1. console.firebase.google.com → **Add project** → name it (e.g. `crewline`)
2. Left sidebar → **Build → Firestore Database** → Create database → start in
   **production mode** (we control access with security rules, not test mode)
3. Gear icon (top left) → **Project settings → Service accounts** →
   **Generate new private key** — downloads a `.json` file
4. Open that file in any text editor, copy the **entire contents**, and paste
   it as the value of `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in Railway. Railway's
   variable box accepts multi-line/JSON values fine.
5. Add your building as a **site** from the dashboard — **Sites → + Add site**.
   Right-click the spot on Google Maps and the coordinates are the first thing
   in the menu; paste them into Latitude and Longitude and leave the radius at
   75m. The clock-in geofence comes from the site, so nothing works until at
   least one exists. (Sites live in Firestore, so no code edit and no redeploy.)

The first time a clock-out happens, Firestore may reply with an error
containing a link to create a composite index (needed for the
"find my open shift" query) — click the link, it builds the index for you,
no config needed beyond that one click.

## Step 4 — Connect Meta to your Railway URL

1. Meta App dashboard → WhatsApp → **Configuration**
2. Callback URL: `https://<your-railway-domain>/webhook/whatsapp`
3. Verify token: the exact value you invented for `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`
4. Click **Verify and save** — Railway's deploy logs should show
   `verification handshake OK`
5. Under **Webhook fields**, subscribe to **messages**

## Step 5 — Register your own phone number

The skeleton only replies fully to numbers it recognises. Edit the seed
record — in the browser:

1. In your GitHub repo, open `store.js`
2. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file)
3. Replace `61400000000` with your own number — international format,
   country code, **no +** (e.g. an Australian 0412 345 678 becomes
   `61412345678`)
4. **Commit changes** — Railway redeploys in about a minute

That edit-on-GitHub → auto-redeploy loop is your entire dev workflow from
now on. No terminal, ever.

## Step 6 — Test the pipe

Send a WhatsApp message from your phone to the test number shown on
Meta's **API Setup** page. Try the full clock in/out flow:

1. Text **"in"** → the bot replies with a one-tap **share location** button
2. Tap it → if you're within range of the site you're rostered to, you get
   **"Clocked in at [site], [name] — have a good shift!"**
3. Text **"out"** → share location again → **"Clocked out — that was a
   0.0hr shift"** (0.0hr is correct if you test in/out within the same
   minute — real shifts will show real hours)

Message from an unregistered number and you get the polite
"not registered" reply. Share a location from far outside the site's
radius and you'll get the "flagged for your manager to review" reply
instead of a hard block — that's the deliberate no-accuracy-data design
from the decisions log working as intended.

With more than one site, the site is taken from your **rostered shift** for
that day, so put yourself on the Service Board first. If you're not rostered
anywhere the bot says so rather than guessing a building — an unresolved site
is refused, not flagged. With exactly one site it's used automatically and the
roster doesn't come into it.

## What's next (build order)

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Webhook skeleton | ✅ |
| 2 | Clock in/out — GPS geofence, Firestore `shifts`, manager-review flagging | ✅ this repo |
| 3 | Manager dashboard (read-only: who's on shift, review flagged clock-ins) | next |
| 4 | Stock from invoice photo — Claude vision, confirm flow | |
| 5 | Daily P&L — fixed-cost setup + till photo | |
| 6 | Alerts — no-show, labour % (needs Meta template approval — start early!) | |
| 7 | Recipe lookup | |

### Agency model

`docs/agencymodelshape.md` sets out a second build order, for running this as a
labour-hire agency supplying casual staff to many hotels.

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sites and a shift-level geofence | ✅ |
| 2 | Requests, offers and the blast engine | ✅ |
| 3 | Weekly availability and the free-today pool | ✅ |
| 4 | Client intake over chat | ✅ |
| 5 | Compliance gate and hours cap | ✅ |
| 6 | Timesheet sign-off, bill rates, margin | ✅ |
| 7 | Reporting | ✅ |

**Step 1** put one geofence per building in a `sites` collection, so a clock-in
is checked against the site on that person's rostered shift instead of one
radius per tenant. Add sites from the dashboard's **Sites** section.

**Step 2** added staffing requests and the dispatch engine. Raise a request from
**Staffing Requests → + Raise request** and the blast starts immediately:

- **The lane is derived from the start time, never declared.** Under twelve
  hours out is urgent (10-minute waves), further out is planned (2-hour waves).
  Nobody picks a priority — the API refuses to accept one.
- Staff answer over WhatsApp with **"yes"** / **"no"**, or **"yes H7K2"** when
  they have more than one offer open. First come, first served, and the claim is
  atomic, so two people answering together can never take the same seat.
- Accepting books the person onto the Service Board at the request's site, which
  is what makes their clock-in resolve the right building.
- **Auto-backfill:** no clock-in fifteen minutes after a rostered start fires
  the urgent blast on its own. The supervisor notices the gap at 7:15; the
  replacement was accepted at 7:04.

The engine is a tick loop, not a set of timers: all dispatch state lives on the
request documents, so a redeploy mid-blast resumes instead of abandoning a
half-filled request. Set `DISPATCH_DISABLED=1` to run an instance without it —
needed if you ever point a second instance at the same Firestore project, so two
loops don't both blast the same request.

**Step 3** added weekly availability, so the blast waves now mean what they say.
Staff answer in three blocks — **AM** 06:00–14:00, **PM** 14:00–22:00,
**Night** 22:00–06:00 — and the system stores real times, so matching stays
exact. A night belongs to the date it starts on: "Friday night" is Friday into
Saturday.

**Three states, not two: available, unavailable, and unknown.** Silence is never
a yes, and it is never a no either. Sending the weekly ping records that we
asked without inventing an answer, so somebody who hasn't replied stays unknown
and simply waits for a later wave.

Nobody in the office types availability. The capture ladder, in order of
leverage — staff reply on WhatsApp:

| Reply | What it does |
|---|---|
| `same` | Repeats last week in one word, or the standing pattern if they've never answered. The highest-leverage rung. |
| `none` | An explicit "can't work next week" — a real answer, so they stop being offered shifts. |
| `today` | Joins the free-today pool for about 12 hours. Opt-in, self-expiring, first refusal on today's work. |
| `mon am pm, fri all` | The shorthand, for the people who like typing. Ranges (`mon-fri am`) work too. |
| a tap | A signed one-tap link to a 7 × 3 chip grid. No login, no password. Twenty seconds. |

The weekly cycle runs itself: **ask Wednesday, chase Friday, expire with the
week**, so supply is on the board before the hotels' requests land. Nobody is
pinged twice and nobody who has answered is chased.

Set **`LINK_SIGNING_SECRET`** (16+ characters) and **`PUBLIC_BASE_URL`** for the
one-tap links to work. Without them the ping falls back to the shorthand hint
rather than sending a broken link — the app refuses to issue an unsigned link,
because that would let anyone submit anyone's availability by editing a URL.

Wave 2 reaches **only** the unknown, not everyone we haven't heard a yes from.
Somebody who told us they're unavailable has answered, and blasting them again is
how a casual pool learns to ignore the messages. Only the urgent lane's third
wave overrides that, and the message says so.

**Step 4** put client intake on the same WhatsApp number. **One number, two
conversations** — sender identity decides which one you're in:

1. A number registered as a **requester** on a site is a hotel ordering staff.
   Checked first, so an agency supervisor who is also on the staff list is
   ordering when they type "need 3 housekeepers", not clocking in.
2. A number in the staff collection is a **worker**.
3. Anything else is asked to have its manager register it. **Only registered
   numbers can order.**

Register them per site: **`POST /api/sites/:id/requesters`** with
`{requesters: [{phone, name}]}`.

The hotel side of the conversation:

```
←  need 3 housekeepers tomorrow 7am
→  3 × Housekeeping — Hilton Sydney
   Tue, 11 Aug, 07:00–15:00
   (I've assumed an 8 hour shift — tell me if it's different.)
   Reply CONFIRM to send it, or CANCEL to start again.
←  confirm
→  Confirmed — H7K2. Searching now, I'll message you as people accept.
→  1 of 3 filled for H7K2: Maria S.
```

**Never dispatch on an unconfirmed parse.** That confirm step is the contract,
the audit trail, and the guard against sending thirty people because somebody
typed "30" meaning "3:00". The guard is structural rather than a rule the code
has to remember: a draft is stored with `confirmedAt: null`, and the blast
engine's work list excludes those, so an unconfirmed order physically cannot go
out. Anything the parser can't work out is asked for, never assumed. A hotel can
type `status` any time for names and fill counts.

Phone calls aren't banned, they're out-competed. When one happens, the operator
types it into the dashboard against the requester's number — same collection,
same fields. A written trail of what was ordered is what wins invoice disputes.

**Step 5** added the compliance gate and the fortnight hours cap. **A gate, not a
display panel** — a dashboard showing an expired RSA in red while the person
keeps getting offered bar shifts hasn't solved anything. Two rules:

1. **A document that exists and has expired blocks the person.** No configuration
   needed: if you're tracking somebody's police check and it lapsed, placing them
   is your liability. Expiry is measured against the **end** of the shift, since
   somebody whose visa expires at noon can't lawfully work until 3pm.
2. **A document a role requires and the person doesn't hold blocks that role.**
   Configured per tenant via `POST /api/settings/compliance` — only you know your
   clients demand an RSA for bar work. Leaving it unset still leaves rule 1 in
   force.

The gate runs twice: when building each wave, and again the moment somebody
accepts. A planned lane's accept window is two hours, and a document can lapse
inside it. Nothing briefly holds a seat.

**The fortnight cap is checked as a worst case.** Set
`compliance.visa.hoursCapPerFortnight` and hours are counted across *all* sites,
from worked shifts and future bookings alike. Checking only the 14 days ending at
the shift is leaky — with a 24h cap and 16h booked, accepting the 13th passes,
then the 12th also passes because the 13th falls outside *its* window: four days,
32 hours, cap intact. So every 14-day window containing the shift is evaluated
and the worst one blocks. No order of accepting shifts can get somebody over.

Reports come from the same functions the gate uses, so they can never disagree
with what actually blocks: `GET /api/compliance` for the 30-day pipeline (who
lapses, and how many placements that endangers) and `GET /api/hours` for
committed hours per person.

**Step 6** added bill rates, one-tap sign-off and the margin report.

```
→  Shift complete — Hilton Sydney, Mon 10 Aug.
   · Maria — 8.0 hrs
   · Ahmed — 8.0 hrs
   16.0 hrs total.
   Reply APPROVE to sign off, or QUERY plus a note if something's wrong.
←  approve
→  Signed off — 16.0 hrs. This goes on your 10 Aug invoice.
```

Set a rate card per site with `POST /api/sites/:id/bill-rates`
(`{housekeeping: 45, default: 40}`) and your on-costs once with
`POST /api/settings/on-costs`.

**Approval is what makes an hour billable.** An unapproved shift is a worklist
item, not an invoice line, and the margin report counts only approved hours —
so the number can't be inflated by hours a client hasn't agreed to. A queried
shift is held off the invoice with its note kept. Out-of-radius clock-ins are
never sent for client sign-off; that's a manager's call first.

**Pay rates are never visible to the site.** If a hotel negotiates directly with
a casual the margin model breaks quietly, so every client-facing message goes
through one formatter that has no access to a rate or a margin — with tests
asserting nothing leaks.

Two things the margin maths gets right that are easy to get wrong:

- **On-costs compound.** Casual loading is part of the wage, so super, payroll
  tax and workers' comp are levied on the *loaded* wage. Computing them off the
  base understates every shift — the difference between a thin margin and none.
  A 40% gross mark-up is a loss once on-costs are counted.
- **An absent rate is `null`, never zero.** A shift with no bill rate is reported
  as unbillable rather than as a loss; one with no pay rate is flagged rather
  than shown as 100% margin.

`GET /api/reports/margin` splits by lane, because blending planned and urgent
hides both — urgent skews to nights and weekends, and reported apart it becomes
a column you can price against.

**Step 7** added the reports. `GET /api/reports/agency?from=&to=&week=` returns
all of them in one call:

| Report | Split | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| Fill rate | planned / urgent | The headline. Two denominators: share of *seats* filled, and share of *requests* filled completely. |
| Time to fill | urgent | Median minutes, **from the hotel's confirm** — time spent waiting for them to reply isn't yours. |
| Lost demand | site & hour | Seats you couldn't fill. "We never fill 6am Saturdays" is actionable; a daily total isn't. |
| Supply vs demand | 7 × 3 grid | Declared headcount against demand per day-block. Shows you're three Night people short on Saturday before you fail. |
| Margin | planned / urgent | Approved hours only. |
| Reliability | per person | Offered, accepted, showed, late, no-showed. |
| Response latency | per person | Median seconds to answer. Your genuine top staff. |
| Free-today by hour | urgent | Thin at 5am Saturdays is a recruitment target, months early. |
| Client hours | per site | Approved / awaiting / queried kept apart — only the first is invoiceable. |

Three things the reports are careful about:

- **A denominator of zero reports `null`, not 0%.** "0% fill rate" and "no
  requests yet" look identical otherwise, and only one of them is a problem.
- **Nothing recomputes a rule.** Fill rate reads `outcome`, latency reads the
  offer timestamps, margin calls the same function the invoicing view does. A
  report that re-derives a rule eventually disagrees with what enforced it.
- **Cancelled requests are neither a hit nor a miss.** A hotel changing its mind
  must not drag the fill rate down.

Supply counts people who said yes **and aren't already booked** in that cell — a
declaration from somebody already working isn't available supply, and counting it
is how a grid tells you you're fine on a day you aren't.

## Security notes (do not skip)

- Secrets live **only** in Railway's Variables tab — never in the code, never
  committed to GitHub. `.gitignore` blocks `.env` files as a safety net.
- Every webhook POST is signature-verified against `META_APP_SECRET`
  (`verifySignature.js`). Never disable this, including in testing.
- When Firestore arrives (step 2): every document carries `tenantId`, and
  security rules must enforce it — see "Data safety & role-based access
  control" in the decisions log. The bot backend additionally passes every
  outgoing reply through a role-visibility check before sending; financial
  fields never reach staff-role numbers.

## Running locally instead (optional, developers only)

If you ever do work from a machine with Node 18+ installed:
`npm install`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it, then
`node --env-file=.env server.js` (or `npm run dev` to reload on save) and tunnel
with ngrok. The browser-only path above is the recommended one.

`npm test` runs the suite (node's built-in test runner — no dependencies, so it
works on a fresh clone before `npm install`). It covers site resolution, the
clock in/out geofence path, and the dispatch engine — lane derivation, wave
progression, the first-come race, expiry, and backfill deduping — against the
in-memory stores. Time is injected rather than slept on, so the whole suite runs
in under a second.
