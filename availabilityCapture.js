 * Capture — nobody in the office types availability.

 * The ladder from docs/agencymodelshape.md, in order of leverage. Each rung
 * catches most of whoever is left:
 *
 *   1. "same"           — one word repeats last week. Should resolve the clear
 *                         majority of a settled pool, and is the highest-leverage
 *                         thing in the whole design.
 *   2. standing pattern — captured once at onboarding, turns the weekly ping
 *                         into confirm-or-amend.
 *   3. the grid         — a signed one-tap link, twenty seconds, no login.
 *   4. shorthand        — "mon am pm, wed night, fri all", for the typists.
 *                         Costs nothing to keep, will always be a minority.
 *   5. "today"          — the free-today pool, the same-day answer.
 *
 * Weekly cycle: **ask Wednesday, chase Friday, expire with the week** — so
 * supply is on the board before the hotels' requests land.
