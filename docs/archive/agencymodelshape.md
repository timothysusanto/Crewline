# Agency model — system shape

Design note for extending Hospitality OS from a single-venue tool to a
labour-hire agency supplying casual staff to Sydney hotels.

**Context:** ~300 casuals, ~15 hotel sites, both staff *and* hotels already
on WhatsApp. No portal, no logins, no app installs on either side.

---

## The shape: one pool, two lanes, one number

A hotel asking for four housekeepers next Tuesday and a hotel that just lost a
night porter at 5am are not the same business. The first is a matching problem
solved with data. The second is a race won with speed. They share a staff pool
and a phone number — and almost nothing else.

**The lane is derived from the shift start time, never declared.** Under twelve
hours out is urgent, otherwise planned. Nobody at the hotel picks a priority.

---

## Availability: three blocks cover the clock

Free-typed time ranges fail at scale — too much typing, too many formats.
Hotels already cut the day into three shifts, so use those as the unit of
answer. Staff *answer* in blocks; the system *stores* real times, so matching
and reporting stay exact.

| Block | Hours | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **AM** | 06:00–14:00 | Housekeeping, breakfast, early F&B |
| **PM** | 14:00–22:00 | Lunch/dinner service, banquets, evening reception |
| **Night** | 22:00–06:00 | Night audit, security, overnight porter |

- No gaps, no overlaps, and the words already mean this to a hotel.
- A person's week is a subset of **21 cells** (7 days × 3 blocks). A shift
  matches if its hours fall inside a declared block — a 17:00–23:00 dinner
  service is simply PM.
- **A night belongs to the date it starts on.** "Friday night" means Friday into
  Saturday, because that is what staff mean. Payroll still splits at midnight;
  the two are allowed to differ as long as it's deliberate.
- Availability lives in a **document per person per week**, not as a field on
  the staff record. A casual with a second job has a different answer every
  week, and last month's answer must never be reused as this week's.

> **Three states, not two: available, unavailable, and unknown.** Silence is
> never a yes. Unknown isn't a failure either — it just means that person waits
> for a later wave.

## Capture: nobody in the office types availability

Each rung catches most of whoever is left. Weekly cycle: **ask Wednesday, chase
Friday, expire with the week** — supply is on the board before the hotels'
requests land.

1. **"Same again" — one button.** A settled casual pool mostly repeats. This
   single tap should resolve the clear majority of 300 people, and it's the
   highest-leverage thing in the whole design.
2. **A standing pattern, set once.** "Normally free AM Mon–Fri", captured at
   onboarding. Turns the weekly ping into confirm-or-amend.
3. **The grid, for whoever changed.** A signed one-tap link — no login, no
   password — to a 7 × 3 chip grid. Twenty seconds. Becomes an in-chat form
   later; staff won't notice the difference.
4. **Text shorthand**, for the people who like typing: `mon am pm, wed night,
   fri all`. Costs nothing to keep, will always be a minority.
5. **The free-today pool — the same-day answer.** A separate, opt-in,
   self-expiring signal: tap once in the morning and you're a hot lead for ~12
   hours, then it decays on its own. Opt-in makes it high-signal — nobody taps
   it unless they want a shift today — and the incentive is real: first refusal
   on today's work.

> **The roster is the only availability data that's never wrong.** Whoever is
> already booked is known with certainty. On a day with 120 people working,
> that's 40% of the pool filtered out with zero guessing — use it as a hard
> negative filter on both lanes.

## Dispatch: one blast engine, configured twice

Waves, an atomic first-come claim, auto-expiry, and response timing — built
once. The two lanes are the same machine with different dials.

| | **Planned (12h+ out)** | **Urgent (under 12h)** |
|---|---|---|
| Match on | Availability, compliance, hours cap | Who answers fast; availability is a hint |
| Wave 1 | Available + compliant, ranked by reliability | Free-today pool, ranked by median response time |
| Wave 2 | +2h — availability unknown but compliant | +10 min — unknown but compliant |
| Wave 3 | — | +20 min — everyone compliant, flagged urgent |
| Accept window | 2 hours | 10 minutes, then next wave |
| Sells on | Price and consistency | Speed — bill it at a premium |

A person with flawless availability data who replies in three hours is worthless
at 5:30am. **Median response time is the most valuable number in a same-day
business**, and it only exists if every offer records when it was sent and when
it was answered.

> **Auto-backfill closes the loop.** No clock-in fifteen minutes after a shift
> starts triggers the urgent blast automatically and tells the operator it's
> already running. The supervisor notices the gap at 7:15am; the replacement was
> accepted at 7:04.

## Message flows

Both sides run on the same number. Sender identity decides which conversation
you're in — the same gate that already turns away unregistered staff in
`router.js`.

**Staff, Wednesday:**

```
→  Next week, 11–17 Aug.
   Last week you were free Mon AM, Wed AM/PM, Fri AM.
   [Same again] [Change it] [Not available]
←  Same again
→  Locked in. You'll get offers as they come.

←  today
→  You're in the pool for today until 8pm.
```

**Hotel, 05:40:**

```
←  need 3 housekeepers tomorrow 7am
→  3 × Housekeeping — Hilton Sydney
   Tue 5 Aug, 07:00–15:00
   [Confirm] [Edit]
←  Confirm
→  Searching — 41 people notified.
→  2 of 3 filled: Maria S., Ahmed K.
→  All 3 confirmed. Jo T. joins them.
```

**Hotel, shift day:**

```
→  Maria clocked in 06:52 · Ahmed 06:58 · Jo 07:12, 12 min late
→  Shift complete — 24.0 hrs total.  [Approve] [Query]
←  Approve
→  Signed off. This goes on your 5 Aug invoice.
```

- **Free text in, structured confirmation back.** Never dispatch on an
  unconfirmed parse — that confirm step is the contract, the audit trail, and
  the guard against sending thirty people.
- **Only registered numbers can order.** Requesters listed per site; unknown
  numbers get asked to have their manager register.
- **Phone calls aren't banned, they're out-competed.** When one happens, the
  operator types it into the same thread so a record exists. A written trail of
  what was ordered is what wins invoice disputes.

## Data model

Every report depends on the shift carrying its site, the request it filled, and
both rates. Miss one field now and the report is impossible to reconstruct.

| Collection | Fields |
|---|---|
| `sites/{siteId}` **new** | name · **geofence {lat, lng, radiusMeters}** · address · requesters[] · billRates{role} |
| `staff/{phone}` | tenantId · name · roles[] · payRate · **standingPattern** · **compliance{rsa, police, visa, expiry}** · **reliability{offered, accepted, showed, late, noShow, medianResponseSec}** |
| `availability/{tenant_phone_weekStart}` **new** | weekStart · days{"YYYY-MM-DD": ["AM","PM","NIGHT"]} · source · submittedAt |
| `freeToday/{phone}` **new** | declaredAt · expiresAt (self-expiring, never edited by an operator) |
| `requests/{requestId}` **new** | siteId · role · startsAt · endsAt · headcount · filled · requestedBy · **lane** · createdAt · confirmedAt · filledAt · outcome |
| `offers/{offerId}` **new** | requestId · phone · wave · sentAt · respondedAt · outcome (accepted/declined/expired) |
| `shifts/{shiftId}` | phone · **siteId** · **requestId** · **role** · clockIn · clockOut · flagged · **payRate** · **billRate** · approvedBy · approvedAt |

`sites` replaces the single per-tenant geofence in `tenantStore.js` — an agency
sends people to fifteen buildings, so the geofence has to come off the assigned
shift, not off the tenant.

## Reporting: every number splits by lane

Blending planned and urgent hides both. Reported apart, the urgent column
becomes a sales asset you can price against.

| Report | Split | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| **Fill rate** | planned / urgent | The headline number. A planned miss is an ops failure; an urgent miss is a supply problem. |
| **Time to fill** | urgent | Median minutes, request to confirmed. *"87% of same-day filled, median 34 minutes"* is the pitch. |
| **Supply vs demand** | 7 × 3 grid | Declared headcount per day-block against demand. Shows you're twelve Night people short on weekends before you fail to fill. |
| **Margin per placement** | planned / urgent | Bill less pay less on-costs (casual loading, super, payroll tax, workers comp). Urgent skews to nights and weekends — billing it flat while paying penalties loses money. |
| **Lost demand** | by site & hour | Requests declined or unfilled. Invisible today because a phone call leaves no trace. |
| **Reliability** | per person | Offered, accepted, showed, late, no-showed. Feeds wave-1 ranking. |
| **Response latency** | per person | Median seconds to answer an offer. Your genuine top staff. |
| **Free-today pool by hour** | urgent | Thin at 5am Saturdays? A recruitment target, months early. |
| **Compliance pipeline** | 30-day horizon | Who lapses soon and how many placements that endangers. Also a hard gate. |
| **Fortnight hours cap** | per person | Hours across *all* sites. Student-visa exposure, carried by the agency. |
| **Client hours** | per site | Invoicing, with sign-off status per shift. |

---

## Build order

1. **Sites and shift-level geofence.** Until the geofence comes off the assigned
   shift rather than the tenant, clock-in flags every placement and no
   downstream data is trustworthy.
2. **Requests, offers, and the blast engine.** Waves, atomic first-come claim,
   auto-expiry, response timing. Serves both lanes from day one. With step 1,
   auto-backfill on no-show falls out almost free.
3. **Availability and the free-today pool.** Three blocks, per-week documents,
   the "same again" button, the grid link. Deliberately after the engine —
   availability only serves the planned lane, and same-day is half the volume.
4. **Client intake over chat.** Parse, confirm, dispatch. Requester registry per
   site. The status loop back to the hotel. This is what stops the phone
   ringing.
5. **Compliance gate and hours cap.** Expiry blocks assignment; fortnight hours
   across all sites block it too. A gate, not a display panel.
6. **Timesheet sign-off, bill rates, margin.** One-tap approval from the
   supervisor's phone. The existing penalty-rate engine (`server.js`) already
   computes the cost side; adding the bill side turns it into a margin report.
7. **Reporting.** Last, because it's mostly free by then.

## Still open

- **One number or two.** Sender identity can route staff and hotels through a
  single line, which is cheaper and simpler. Two numbers buy separation of tone.
  Decide before step 4.
- **Message costs at 300 staff.** Weekly pings plus every offer are
  business-initiated: approved templates, per-message cost. Model the monthly
  number before quoting an agency — wave 3 of an urgent blast can touch the
  whole pool.
- **Two hotels wanting the same person.** First-come is fair and simple;
  preferred-client priority earns more. Pick one before it happens on a
  Saturday.
- **Who owns the pay rate conversation.** If a hotel negotiates directly with a
  casual, the margin model breaks quietly. Decide whether rates are ever visible
  to the site.
- **Night shifts across midnight.** Availability keyed to the starting date,
  payroll split at midnight — settled here, but every future date query will
  assume one or the other.
